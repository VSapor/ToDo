Notes:

3/14/18:
	So far I have "completed" the code to provide all the specfied functionality: SEARCH, ADD, DELETE, UPDATE including user interfaces.
	Code is exclusively PHP and HTML. I have tried to keep HTML and PHP separate where I could. However, there are exceptions where I
	could not figure out how to implement the functionality without combining. I've tried to logically break code into components. I 
	was trying to reuse code but, again due to my limited knowledge, trying to reuse code was messy and made things more confusing.
	As a result, some scripts/pages seem redundant. If I had more knowledge of JavaScript or SQLJ, for example, I probably could have
	made some of the components more efficient/elegant. 
	
	I've done a fair amount of debugging but by no means exhaustive at this stage. 
	
	Known problems:
	
	1. I do not know how to present a new page for each new page. For example, when the user is on the RESOURCE SEARCH criteria screen and 			SUBMITs, the results are presented on the same screen. 
	2. On pages where there is data populated/posted, I do not know how to present error/warning messages while presenting the same
		 page. Instead, I had to resort to calling an ERROR page and presenting it with a link back to the nav screen. For example, 
		 if a user is on the RESOURCE SEARCH results screen within the DELETE function where he can choose which records to delete, if he
		 SUBMITs w/o selecting any records, instead of a message being presented on the same screen or simply redisplaying the page (no
		 action), they are taken to a warning page with a message NO RECORDS SELECTED. Similarly, on the DELETE and UPDATE CONFIRMATION
		 page where the user is presented with a radio button Y/N to confirm delete, if they click SUBMIT without make a Y/N choice 
		 the DELETE/UPDATE is cancelled and a message screen presented. In practice, this is not how it should be handled. But again, 
		 I could not figure out how to handle it using PHP alone. 
	3. In the same vein, when the message screen is presented and the user tries to use the BACK button, they are presented with an 
		 error screen with the following message:
				 Confirm Form Resubmission
						This webpage requires data that you entered earlier in order to be properly displayed. 
						You can send this data again, but by doing so you will repeat any action this page 
						previously performed.
						Press the reload button to resubmit the data needed to load the page.
						ERR_CACHE_MISS
